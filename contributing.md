## Unit Tests
We ask that before submitting pull requests, 
you check that you code changes pass all of our unit tests.

Unit tests are kept [here](/src/tests/test_nctpy.py).
To run unit tests, 
1. open the terminal or command line
2. set your current directory to the /tests/ folder of this repo
3. run the command `python -m unittest discover -s ../tests -t ..`

Make sure there are no errors or failures before submitting your request.

Thank you!
